## Welcome

Aspiring digital nomad, futurist, systems thinker and Christian.

Absolutely passionate to understand how things work, create and improve systems.
My name is LB (pronounced 'Albi') and this site has a bit of info to help you get to know me.

## Process

What I love to do (even in my sleep) is help individuals and businesses implement systems and processes.

A process works best when it is not the goal unto itself.

Culture trumps process every time, not the other way around.

Software can solve a problem but often a spreadsheet can achieve a process goal without adding new problems first.

Technology serves us best when it enhances an existing system.

I would love to help you add structure where you need it in your business.
